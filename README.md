So, you looked at this repo, right? Isn't it interesting how we can just apply our own CSS by writing a few lines of JS?

Anyway, if you want to try this extension, first download this repo.

**Then follow these steps:**
- Open Chrome and go to the **Extensions** page.
- In the top-right corner, enable **Developer mode**.
- Click the **Load unpacked** button and upload this repo folder... and you’re all set.

<h2 align="center">Congrats visitor, you have unlocked your own browser extension 🗣️🗣️🎊</h2>

### 📝 Small Note

**THIS repo updates continuously, and please don’t be offended if you don’t like the CSS — I like it 😄**
