Quick Faqs - 
<details> <summary><strong>What is this repo for?</strong></summary>
This repo is made for a Chrome extension targeting the KL University ERP portal. Basically, it’s a Chrome extension designed to enhance the KLU ERP website experience.
</details>
<details><summary><strong>What is the purpose , Purpose ఏంటి ⁉️</strong></summary>
Let me ask you this: <br>
Would you really want to give your ERP credentials and personal details—like your attendance—to random websites and then get tired of entering the same information again and again just to know your attendance?
<br>
Personally, I hate that idea.<br>
Like, dude… why should I have to do all that?
<br>
That’s exactly why I built this extension.<br>
There’s no need to share any credentials, no need to enter personal details, and no need to trust third-party websites. Everything works directly on your ERP page itself. I genuinely promise—this extension does not collect, store, or send any of your data anywhere. Your privacy stays with you.
<br>
This isn’t just about attendance either.<br>
It’s a collection of small, useful ideas—things we’ve all thought at some point, like “It would be so much better if our ERP had this feature” or “Why doesn’t it show this properly?” But the ERP is never going to change.
<br>
So instead of waiting, I decided to build those missing features myself and bundle them all into one extension.
